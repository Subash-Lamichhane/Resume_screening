# ResuMatch: Automated Resume Screening System

## Overview

ResuMatch is an advanced automated resume screening system that leverages artificial intelligence and natural language processing to efficiently match resumes with job descriptions. The project aims to streamline the recruitment process by providing accurate and objective resume evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Automated Resume Parsing**: Extracts key information from resumes using advanced NLP techniques
- **Semantic Matching**: Utilizes cosine similarity to compare resumes with job descriptions
- **Multilayer Processing**:
  - Text preprocessing
  - Resume segmentation
  - Entity extraction
  - Semantic similarity scoring
- **User-Friendly Interface**: React-based frontend for easy resume and job description uploads
- **Robust Backend**: FastAPI-powered processing engine

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **NLP Library**: spaCy
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - Sentence Transformers
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Text Processing**: 
  - Cosine Similarity
  - TF-IDF Vectorization

## Project Highlights

- Processes a dataset of 2,000 unique skills
- Employs rule-based entity recognition
- Generates compatibility scores for resumes
- Achieved 0.6991 correlation with human evaluation
